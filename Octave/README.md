## Fit-routine.m
The file *Fit-routine.m* contains an *Octave*-script (*OctCarb*) for the refinement of measured WAXS/WANS data using the model of Ruland and Smarsly (2002). The input parameters are descriped in the file itself and in https://github.com/osswaldo/ngcs/README.md.

### Output of *Fit-routine.m*
During the whole refinement, *Octave* shows a plot with the actual state of refinement (if acivated).
After every refinement step, *Octave* will return the refined values, the reason of the refinement stop, a matrix containing the refined values and the standard deviations. After the whole refinmenent, *Octave* will also return all refined parameters and the resulting microstructure parameters including the mathematically calculated erros. In addition, the used reinfment script, the plots (if activated), the refined parameters and an table containing all parameters and the refined iObs-values and a file containing the output-matrices and other useful values will be exported.

#### Console output
In addition to the informative outputs such as the start and end time, the current refinement step, etc., any errors and, after each refinement, the reason for the end of the refinement, the refined values and an associated matrix are output.

##### Reasons for the end of the refinement
* *Canceled*: Canceled by user
* *Maximum number of iterations.*: The maximum number of iterations has been arrived. You have to increase the parameter *maxIter*.
* *Change in refinement parameters too small.*: Obvious
* *Change in calculated function too small.*: Obvious, see *tolFun*

##### Refined values and matrices
The refined parameters and their values will be output after every refinement step by their name. The corresponding matrix also contains the values (1st column) and the error of it (2nd column, 1-sigma neighborhood of normal distribution). The 3rd and 4th columns contains the 2-sigma and 3-sigma neighborhoods of the normal distributions, respectiveley). An 1-sigma neighborhood of *10* means, that the error could not be calculated.

## General in- and Output parameters for the refinement-script (*OctCarb*)
In general, the input parameters for *iObs*, *iObsPDF* and the associated *.oct* files are the same. The only difference between *iObs* and *iObsPDF* is that *iObsPDF* requires some additional parameters.
Further information about all parameters can be found in the pulblications on top.

## Common warnings/errors during the refinement and how to fix them
There are several errors, which can occur during the refinement process. The most common and their solutions are written down here:

### warning: lower and upper bounds identical for some parameters, fixing the respective parameters
As the warning says, for one or more parameters, the upper and lower bound are identical. You can check the parameters and ignore the warning.

### warning: matrix singular to machine precision, rcond = nan
Some values in the matrix are too close to 0 and your PC cannot calculate it. It is not a big problem, the PC will use 0 instead and forward the refinement. In general, this warning can be ignored.

### some lower bounds larger than upper bounds
You set some lower bound to a higher value than the upper bound. You have to check and correct the parameters.

### no free parameters
The lower and upper bounds of all parameters are fixed to a certain value, so there is nothing which can be refined. At least one parameter must be free.

### __plt2vv__: vector lengths must match
This error typical occurs, if a parameter is changed, which influences the raw data, e.g., measFile, type, nStart, nEnd, nSkip. In the most of the cases, the error can resolved by restarting Octave.

### svd: cannot take SVD of matrix containing Inf or NaN values
There are a lot of reasons, why this error is shown. It might be, that the starting parameters are too “bad”, the amount of measurement is to low, i.e. nSkip is to high or there is to less RAM available. First, you can ignore this error,* Octave* will try to calculate the Matrix again (10 times). If the script stops, the start parameters should be refined manually.

### error: Too many errors when refine
This is not a specific error, it occurs, if something goes wrong. There should be another error or warning in the output and this is the reason, why the script stops. In principle, all manually changed parameters should be checked.

### The values of the error Matrix are 10, 20 and 30
These values are not the real errors, but something like a placeholder or default value. A standard deviation of 10 means, that the error cannot be calculated correctly. This is a very common mistake when trying to refine too many parameters at the same time.

## Installation
In principle,* Octave* is available for Microsoft Windows, Aplle macOS, GNU/Linux ad BSD systems. While a precompiled and executable* Octave* installer is available for Windows,* Octave* must be compiled on the system itself for other systems.
Independent of the system, some additional plugins for* Octave* have to be installed manually.

### Install* Octave* under Windows (tested on Windows 10 64 bit)
For Windows, an executable * .exe file can be downloaded directly: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download

#### Update* Octave* under Windows
Run 'Install* Octave* under Windows' again.

### Install* Octave* under macOS (tested on macOS Catalina 10.15.7)
Octave for macOS can be installed using a package manager like (Homebrew, MacPorts and Spack). In addition, a launcher app using AppleScript can also be created.
The most easiest way is to use Homebrew (https://brew.sh/), so only this way will be described.

#### Install* Octave* using Homebrew
The actual instruction is available under https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS
0. Information: The entire process can take up to a few hours, but the actual working time in which YOU have to do something is only a few minutes.
1. Install Xcode via the App Store
2. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
brew update
brew install octave
```

3. To install a special Octave version (for example 6.3.0), download "Octave.rb" and run the following command (if you want to install another version, change the versions in "url" and "mirror" in "Octave.rb":
```bash
brew install --build-from-source ~/Downloads/Octave.rb
```

##### Further tips
In addition,* Octave* can also be compiled against gnuplot instead of qt. This result might perform better, so it is recommended to run also the following commands:
0. Information: The entire process can take up to a few hours, but the actual working time in which YOU have to do something is only a few minutes.
1. Open the file ~/.octaverc and paste the in:
```text
setenv('GNUTERM','qt')
graphics_toolkit("gnuplot")
```
2. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:
```bash
sudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local/share/ghostscript
brew link --overwrite ghostscript
brew install octave
# If install returns an error about not having a formular for octave, use the following command:
brew tap --repair
```

##### Update* Octave* under macOS using Homebrew
In addition,* Octave* can also be compiled against gnuplot instead of qt. This result might perform better, so it is recommended to run also the following commands:
0. Information: The entire process can take up to a few hours, but the actual working time in which YOU have to do something is only a few minutes.
1. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:
```bash
brew update && brew upgrade octave
```

### Install* Octave* under Linux
There are many different Linux distributions, so it is impossible to write one guide for all of them. Therefore, only the most relevant and widely used Linux distributions are considered. In principle,* Octave* can be installed with a precompiled package or by compiling on the operating system itself. Since the compilation is sometimes very complicated and requires a high level of prior knowledge, this procedure is NOT described here. The corresponding instructions can be found here: https://wiki.octave.org/Category:Installation

### *Important*: Install additional packages/plugins (optim)
In order to use the script to refine wide-angle X-ray/neutron scattering (WAXS/WANS) data of NGCs using the Octave-script in this repository, some additional plugins must be installed.
*optim* is used to perform the mathimatical refinement/minimalization operations. *optim* itself need *struct* and *statistics* as dependencies and *statistis* in turn uses *io*. If an error occurs during the installation of *optim*, it is usually because the dependencies mentioned are missing. These must then also be installed. 
Basically, either the automatic package installation program from Octave, which downloads and installs the package, or the manual package installation program, in which you have to download the packages manually, can be used for the installation * optim *.
In principle, manual installation should only be used if the automatic installation program has failed.

#### Automatic installation of *optim*
##### Installation of *optim*
The *optim* package is available under https://octave.sourceforge.io/optim/
To install *optim* either open the Octave-GUI or the Octave-CLI and execute the following command:
```octave
pkg install -forge optim
```

If the installation failed due to missing dependencies, you have to install *struct*, *statistics* and *io* **before** the installation of *optim*.
Aftwerwards, either open the Octave-GUI or the Octave-CLI and execute the following command again:
```octave
pkg install -forge optim
```

##### Installation of *struct*
To install *struct* either open the Octave-GUI or the Octave-CLI and execute the following command:
```octave
pkg install -struct optim
```

##### Installation of *statistics*
To install *statistics*, you first have to install *io*. To do this, either open the Octave-GUI or the Octave-CLI and execute the following commands:
```octave
pkg install -forge io
pkg install -forge statistics
```

### Manual installation of *optim*
If the automatic installation failed, you can also install *optim* and its dependenceis maunal.
1. Download *optim* and the needed dependecies (*structs*, *statistics* and *io*):
```links
https://octave.sourceforge.io/optim/
https://octave.sourceforge.io/struct/index.html
https://octave.sourceforge.io/statistics/index.html
https://octave.sourceforge.io/io/index.html
```

2. Install first *io*, then *structs* and *statistics* and last *optim*. To do this, either open the Octave-GUI or the Octave-CLI and execute the following commands.
 <*path_to_file*> is the path, there the previous downloaded files are saved. The quotes (') are only necessarry, if the path or file name contains spaces. <*version*> is the version of the downloaded package, i.e. the filename.
```octave
pkg install '<*path_to_file*>/io-<*version*>.tar.gz'
pkg install '<*path_to_file*>/struct-<*version*>.tar.gz'
pkg install '<*path_to_file*>/statistics-<*version*>.tar.gz'
pkg install '<*path_to_file*>/optim-<*version*>.tar.gz'
```
