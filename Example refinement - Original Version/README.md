# Example-Refinement - Original Version

In this directory, an updated example refinement is provided. The files should match the explanations in the videos. However, the files and the videos were created differently, so slightly differences might occur.
Since some bugs have been fixed in refinement scripts in, the files in the "Update" directory should be used in future works.
The refinement was performed using Octave 5.2.0.
